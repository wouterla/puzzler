Experiment in TDD to grow an algorithm to solve my kids' 'smart game' puzzles.

The puzzles consist of a grid board of 11x5, upon which 12 coloured pieces of
varying shapes (consisting of small, joined balls) can be placed. The object of
the puzzle is, given a certain starting state (with a number of pieces placed
on the board) to fill the complete board with the rest of the pieces.

It's harder than you'd think, really!

This project is simply to create a virtual version of the gameboard and pieces
(done, as long as no-one expects fancy (or any) graphics), and an algorithm to 
solve the puzzles. The challenge is to do this Test Driven, and see whether
growing such an algorithm works even for someone who is as algorithmically 
challenged like me.
